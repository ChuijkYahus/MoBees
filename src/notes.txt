// TODO
- DONE - add night vision to rocky bees ONLY (for now)
- DONE - add flower type stone for rocky bees
- DONE - add flower type ores, for ore-specific bees
- DONE - add magic bee sprite for some special bees
- DONE - harmonic bee should have music/jukebox effect (or amethyst chime? might be easier)
- DONE - alveary sun lamp should glow in game when on?
- DONE - alveary mutator should consume some mutation accelerator item (or fluid, canister for base game)
- DONE - alveary frame housing
 - alveary stimulator ^ upgrade of frame housing, expensive
 - witchy bee only flies in the rain?
 - alveary flower box (holds flower item, no need to place them down?) - maybe also gives a boost to pollination, can be a mini game?
   - maybe the flower box increases in fertility as it goes on
 - alveary blocks dont drop their contents or themselves
 - mutator should hold its data when it drops

add excited bee lightning effect
refinery for bee ore produce? bit silly to combine bits into a whole ingot directly
